# Renku Test GPU

This repository contains a couple of tests to validate GPU computing is working as expected in a renku session, depending on the resource pool you chose when starting the session.

This is repository is mainly aimed at administrators to validate framework updates.

## Running the tests

1. You can open and run the cellules of the Jupyter Notebook

2. If things do not work as expected, you can try to use the Nvidia tools from a console tab to see what is going on.
